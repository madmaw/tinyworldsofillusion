        This game uses optical illusions to try and create a unique experience for the player. This game relies heavily on in-browser SVG support, as such it requires Chrome to play.

        There's also a bonus thing that will occasionally pop open in the centre of the screen. Click on it with the mouse to get a multiplier, or just ignore it.

        <h2>Modes</h2>
        <p>
            The game comes in several flavours. The one closest to the original vision is "spin", where you don't control the turret, just the firing. The rationale being that it helps
            keep the eye focused on the centre of the screen, which is generally necessary for the illusions to work at all.
